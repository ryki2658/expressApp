Notes

Steps

1.**SETUP**
	-npm init (creates a package.json file)
	-Manually added dependencies to package.json
		"dependencies":{
  			"express":"*",
  			"body-parser":"*"
  		},
	-npm install

2.**app.js**
	-add required files from node_modules(var express = require('express'); ect...)
	-Create routes and insert middleware (scope is very important)

3.**Template Engine (ejs)**
	-Navagation
		navbar-fixed-top changed to navbar-top to keep page content from being covered. Another solution would be to add padding into the body tag css

4.**MongoDB**
	-Usage
		-Start session by navigating to mongodb/bin and run "mongod"
		-In a new treminal window from mongodb/bin run "./mongo"


***TIPS***
	- '--save' tag will add itself to package.json
